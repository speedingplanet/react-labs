Build an unordered list of students

Import students from src/data/students.json

Below the <h3>, create an unordered list. Within the list, iterate over the 
students array, printing out the first and last name of each student.
Don't forget to add a key attribute to the <li> as well!

Check out your code in the browser to see if it works.
