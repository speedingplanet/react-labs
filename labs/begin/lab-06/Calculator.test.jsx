/*
Two sets of changes: one architectural, and one test-based

Architectural:
Wrap the set of tests below in a `describe` block. 
Use `beforeEach` to render the `Calculator` component before each test
Remove the call to `render(<Calculator />)` from each individual test

Test-based:
Go through each of the two skipped tests. Make the following changes:
1) CalculatorDisplay's root element now has a test id of 'calculator-display', 
	 so there's no reason to use the `container` anymore
2) Similarly, the .result div under CalculatorDisplay also has a test id
   of 'calculator-result'

Rewrite the test 'Does not display any equation at start' to use the test id.
Rewrite the test 'Displays equation after selecting an operator' to use the test id.

Add a test to set the numeric values, select an operator, and then validate that 
CalculatorDisplay shows the equation and has the correct results.
